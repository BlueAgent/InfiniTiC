Only available for MC 1.8.9
Updated to MC 1.8.9, Forge 11.15.1.2318, TConstruct 2.2.1, Java 1.8
NEW JSON format. Should be backward compatible!!??  Check the wiki for an example.
Added some default values, which should make the JSON parsing a little more forgiving.
Removed Infini-Buckets (shed a small tear) in favour of Forge Buckets.
Kept and fixed Infini-Fluids.
Added "/infinitic hand" command.  Very similar (borrowed from) CraftTweaker.  Formatting tweaks for this mod.
Added smelting and casting of Gems (hurrah!).

v0.1.5
Tools and parts are now named correctly (using the "solid" entry from the localizations)
The "Jagged" modifier can now be applied (using a negative Stonebound value) Thanks to Runeforger678 for raising the issue.

 		"locale": "en_US",
 		"solid": "Lapis",
 		"liquid": "Molten Lapis",
 		"bucket": "Lapis Bucket"
 	}]
