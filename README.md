# InfiniTiC

> Because sometimes just going extra isn't going far enough...

InfiniTiC is a mod that adds materials and recipes to Tinker's Construct based on a set of JSON config files.  In the future there will be a repository of config files for various mods, so that it's relatively easy to add files as and when you like.  This mod works on my computer, but that is currently no guarantee of anything at all.  Use at your own risk.  This mod is not stable enough to be used in a nuclear environment.

## Credit where credit is due.

Various people (TODO: Credit people), but mainly Bonii, mDiyo, and the person on IRC who helped me, whose name I can't remember right at this moment.

## How to build

```sh
git clone yada yada
cd InfiniTiC
./gradlew build
```

May or may not work.
