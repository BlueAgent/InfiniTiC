# InfiniTiC

> Because sometimes just going extra isn't going far enough...

InfiniTiC is a mod that adds materials and recipes to Tinker's Construct based on a set of JSON config files.  In the future there will be a repository of config files for various mods, so that it's relatively easy to add files as and when you like.  This mod works on my computer, but that is currently no guarantee of anything at all.  Use at your own risk.  This mod is not stable enough to be used in a nuclear environment.

## Credit where credit is due.

- Notch, Mojang, & others for creating and updating Minecraft
- LexManos, CPW, & others for creating and updating Forge
- mDiyo for first constructing TiC
- Bonii for continuing the mod, and for the updated IguanaTweaks repo (from which much of this repo was based)
- tterag, diesieben07 for giving a hand on IRC
